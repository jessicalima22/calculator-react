This is a classic calculator, but it's not such a simple project!

With a maximun of 16 characters, it is made to avoid typos!

In order to practice React's functionalities, the components were separated from the main index page, wich made it possible to work lifting up the different states!

Also, the addition of parentheses increased all the possibilities for error, requiring a lot of meticulous observation before we could get a working operation.

The percentage function, wich is not present in all simple calculators, has also been added!

The use of switch instead of "if" and "else" also helped with the organization and interpretation of the code, making it possible for other devs to reuse the code and understand the logical steps.
